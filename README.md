Enhanced Amateur Radio Capabilities with PipeWire and HackRF

Designed to work with Linux.

Thanks to PipeWire, this project enables seamless integration between WSJT-X and HackRF, unlocking a wide range of possibilities for ham radio enthusiasts. With Hamlib, you can now:  
Operate WSJT-X and likely others across an impressive frequency range of 1 MHz to 6 GHz, covering bands like 160m, 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, 10m, 6m, 2m, 1.25m, 70cm, 30cm, 23cm, 13cm, and 5cm.


With the (poorly) built-in Hamlib server emulation, dynamic switching between RX and TX, along with precise frequency control, is now fully achievable.

Potentially support voice operations alongside digital modes, leveraging the power of Hamlib and Pipewire's versatility.

Key Notes:  
A filter is recommended to minimize spurious emissions and ensure clean signals.

Pipewire on Linux is highly recommended for audio control

Recommended Pipewire configuration:
